![Alt text](demo/Face-Recognition-Attendance-System-Logo.jpg?raw=true "Face-Recognition-Attendance-System")

This project is a POC web application demonstrating the use of facial recognition for marking attendance. It is a web application that can be used by the company to manage attendance of its employees.

## Functionality Supported

- Register new employees.
- Add employee photos.
- View attendance reports of all employees. Attendance can be filtered by date or employee.




## Built Using

 - [OpenCV]() - Open Source Computer Vision and Machine Learning software library
 - [Dlib]() - C++ Library containing Machine Learning Algorithms
 - [face_recognition]() - by Adam Geitgey
 - [Flask]() - Python framework for web development

## Face Detection

- Dlib's HOG facial detector.

## Facial Landmark Detection

- Dlib's 68 point shape predictor

## Extraction of Facial Embeddings

- face_recognition by Adam Geitgey

## Classification of Unknown Embedding

- using a Linear SVM (scikit-learn)
- The application was tested on data from 20 Person

## Scope of the project ðŸš€

Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials. This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. This project also convers web development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month.
